Website Scraping and Question Answering App
This project allows users to scrape text data from a website and use it for answering questions. The app leverages LangChain, FAISS, HuggingFace embeddings, and a retrieval-based question-answering system powered by a language model. The Streamlit interface makes it easy for users to interact with the model by submitting URLs and asking questions based on the scraped content.

Features:
Web Scraping: Scrape textual content from a provided URL.
Document Chunking: Split the text into chunks for efficient processing.
Question Answering: Ask questions and get context-based answers using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach.
FAISS Vector Store: Use FAISS for fast and efficient similarity search in high-dimensional embeddings.
Step 1: Clone the Repository

Step 2: Set up the Virtual Environment
(Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the required libraries from the requirements.txt file:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Set Up API Keys
Make sure you have a .env file in the project directory that contains the necessary API keys. For example, if you're using Groq, make sure the following line exists in the .env file:
groq=YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY
If you're using HuggingFace embeddings, make sure to include your HuggingFace token (if necessary).
